                    <p>Well here is another random thought. Blog is the id it is in a wrap class which is just a wrapper for one item. Then inside blog there is intro id which is defined in CSS as #blog #intro. Then there is another formating called class called quote #blog .quote and for p tag in CSS called #blog .quote p</p>
